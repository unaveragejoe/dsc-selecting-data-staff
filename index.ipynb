For example, you could sort by the `customerName` column if you wished to get results in alphabetical order. By default, `ORDER BY` is ascending. So, as with the above example, if you want the opposite, use the additional parameter `DESC`. Finally, the limit clause is typically the last argument in a SQL query and simply limits the output to a set number of results."
